************************** Describing the PIC32 Racer Code *********************
The two PWM output compares as well as the PHASE digital IO are defined in the
app initialization.

The PWM duty cycle is changed in the APP_STATE_CHECK_CDC_READ after the values
sent from the phone are read to the PIC. I sent the average COM to the PIC,
so the PIC interprets the average COM and changes the PWM (specifically the
OC1RS and OC2RS) accordingly.
